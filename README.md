# Afterglow Plus


A minimal dark syntax theme forked from [Afterglow Like](https://atom.io/themes/afterglow-like), which itself was converted from [Afterglow](https://github.com/YabataDesign/afterglow-theme) (Sublime Text). The syntax color scheme is mostly derived from [idlefingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/).

I forked this primarily to add selectors for Angular JS tags in HTML/AngularJS documents that were introduced in Atom .200 -- as more are added to Atom I will include them in the theme.

### Notes
Recommend theme [Isotope UI](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui) with a custom background color of #252525.
